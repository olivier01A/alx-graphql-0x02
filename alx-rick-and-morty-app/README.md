# Episode Query – ALX GraphQL Project
Objective

This task demonstrates how to use GraphQL to fetch the details of a specific episode from the Rick and Morty GraphQL API using its ID.

## Project Structure
episode/ │── README.md │── episode-page-1.graphql │── characters-page-1-output.json │── characters-page-2.graphql │── characters-page-2-output.json │── characters-page-3.graphql │── characters-page-3-output.json │── characters-page-4.graphql │── characters-page-4-output.json

## Setup & Usage
# Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com//alx-graphql-0x00.git cd alx-graphql-0x00/episode

## Open the GraphQL Playground
You can run and test this query using the Rick and Morty GraphQL API:

GraphQL Endpoint:

https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql

## Run the Episode Query
Open the file episode-page-1.graphql and paste the following:

query GetEpisodeById { episode(id: 1) { id name air_date episode } }

## Note:
Replace 1 with the desired episode ID to fetch other episodes.

## Expected Output
Example output for id: 1:

{ "data": { "episode": { "id": "1", "name": "Pilot", "air_date": "December 2, 2013", "episode": "S01E01" } } }
